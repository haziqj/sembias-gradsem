  abstract = {The bias of an estimator is defined as the difference of its expected value from the parameter to be estimated, where the expectation is with respect to the model. Loosely speaking, small bias reflects the desire that if an experiment is repeated indefinitely then the average of all the resultant estimates will be close to the parameter value that is estimated. The current article is a review of the still-expanding repository of methods that have been developed to reduce bias in the estimation of parametric models. The review provides a unifying framework where all those methods are seen as attempts to approximate the solution of a simple estimating equation. Of particular focus is the maximum likelihood estimator, which despite being asymptotically unbiased under the usual regularity conditions, has finite-sample bias that can result in significant loss of performance of standard inferential procedures. An informal comparison of the methods is made revealing some useful practical side-effects in the estimation of popular models in practice including: (1) shrinkage of the estimators in binomial and multinomial regression models that guarantees finiteness even in cases of data separation where the maximum likelihood estimator is infinite and (2) inferential benefits for models that require the estimation of dispersion or precision parameters.

  abstract = {It is shown how, in regular parametric problems, the first-order term is removed from the asymptotic bias of maximum likelihood estimates by a suitable modification of the score function. In exponential families with canonical parameterization the effect is to penalize the likelihood by the Jeffreys invariant prior. In binomial logistic models, Poisson log linear models and certain other generalized linear models, the Jeffreys prior penalty function can be imposed in standard regression software using a scheme of iterative adjustments to the data.}

  abstract = {Robust corrections to standard errors and test statistics have wide applications in structural equation modeling (SEM). The original SEM development, due to Satorra and Bentler (1988, 1994), was to account for the effect of nonnormality. Muthén (1993) proposed corrections to accompany certain categorical data estimators, such as cat-LS or cat-DWLS. Other applications of robust corrections exist. Despite the diversity of applications, all robust corrections are constructed using the same underlying rationale: They correct for inefficiency of the chosen estimator. The goal of this article is to make the formulas behind all types of robust corrections more intuitive. This is accomplished by building an analogy with similar equations in linear regression and then by reformulating the SEM model as a nonlinear regression model.},

  abstract = {AbstractRecent studies have pointed out the effect of personality traits on athletes’ performance and success; however, fewer analyses have focused the relation among these features and specific athletic behaviors, skills, and strategies to enhance performance. To fill this void, the present paper provides evidence on what personality traits mostly affect athletes’ mental skills and, in turn, their effect on the performance of a sample of elite swimmers. The main findings were obtained by exploiting a component-based structural equation modeling which allows to analyze the relationships among some psychological constructs, measuring personality traits and mental skills, and a construct measuring sports performance. The partial least squares path modeling was employed, as it is the most recognized method among the component-based approaches. The introduced method simultaneously encompasses latent and emergent variables. Rather than focusing only on objective behaviors or game/race outcomes, such an approach evaluates variables not directly observable related to sport performance, such as cognition and affect, considering measurement error and measurement invariance, as well as the validity and reliability of the obtained latent constructs. The obtained results could be an asset to design strategies and interventions both for coaches and swimmers establishing an innovative use of statistical methods for maximizing athletes’ performance and well-being.},
