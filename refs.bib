  abstract = {Latent class analysis often aims to relate the classes to continuous external consequences (``distal outcomes''), but estimating such relationships necessitates distributional assumptions. Lanza, Tan, and Bray (2013) suggested circumventing such assumptions with their LTB approach: Linear logistic regression of latent class membership on each distal outcome is first used, after which this estimated relationship is reversed using Bayes' rule. However, the LTB approach currently has 3 drawbacks, which we address in this article. First, LTB interchanges the assumption of normality for one of homoskedasticity, or, equivalently, of linearity of the logistic regression, leading to bias. Fortunately, we show introducing higher order terms prevents this bias. Second, we improve coverage rates by replacing approximate standard errors with resampling methods. Finally, we introduce a bias-corrected 3-step version of LTB as a practical alternative to standard LTB. The improved LTB methods are validated by a simulation study, and an example application demonstrates their usefulness.},

Simulation studies and applied examples suggest that the two-step method is an attractive alternative to existing one-step and three-step methods. We derive estimated standard errors for the two-step estimates of the structural model which account for the uncertainty from both steps of the estimation, and show how the method can be implemented in existing software for latent variable modelling.},

However, the weak identifiability of the parameters of the model results in large variability of the estimates and in convergence difficulties in the numerical maximization of the likelihood function. To overcome these issues, in this paper we explore various shrinkage estimation methods, following two main approaches. First, a ridge-type penalty on the guessing parameters is introduced in the likelihood function. The tuning parameter is then selected through various approaches: cross-validation, information criteria or using an empirical Bayes method. The second approach explored is based on the methodology developed to reduce the bias of the maximum likelihood estimator through an adjusted score equation. The performance of the methods is investigated through simulation studies and a real data example.},

Such models have a measurement part (essentially the latent class model) and a structural (causal) part (essentially a system of logit equations). In the three-step approach, a stand-alone measurement model is first defined and its parameters are estimated. Individual predicted scores on the latent variables are then computed from the parameter estimates of the measurement model and the individual observed scoring patterns on the indicators. Finally, these predicted scores are used in the causal part and treated as observed variables. We show that such a naive use of predicted latent scores cannot be recommended since it leads to a systematic underestimation of the strength of the association among the variables in the structural part of the models. However, a simple correction procedure can eliminate this systematic bias. This approach is illustrated on simulated and real data. A method that uses multiple imputation to account for the fact that the predicted latent variables are random variables can produce standard errors for the parameters in the structural part of the model.},

In a way complementary to that of traditional methods, IRT models can be applied to analyze and interpret QOL data collected in various settings. Growing interest in precise QOL measurement in research and clinical settings demands the development of psychometrically sound and clinically meaningful measurement tools. This in turn contributes to the appropriate use of QOL data that are collected. Advances in IRT, also referred to as modern test theory, make it possible for one to more critically evaluate questionnaire performance at its initial development and subsequent refinement and validation. It also offers better methodology to make interpretation of QOL data and comparisons between different populations or occasions more meaningful by converting ordinal observations into linear measures. Empirical results from different studies are provided to assist in the understanding of different IRT models and their applications. It is feasible and promising to integrate IRT models and advanced computer technology to develop a computerized adaptive testing platform to deliver tailored test to arrive at more precise QOL measurement. Administration of more targeted test items according to patient's level of health via CAT with real-time scoring and reporting is not just possibility but a reality. This can facilitate better use of QOL information between patients and physicians, and ultimately improve patient care.},

In maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of any such subpopulation model, the evaluation of the log-likelihood function only requires the summation over a number of terms equal to at most the sample size. It is made clear that the parameters of a hypothesized total population model are consistently and asymptotically efficiently estimated by the values that maximize the log-likelihood function of the corresponding subpopulation model. Next, new likelihood ratio goodness-of-fit tests are proposed as alternatives to the Pearson chi-square goodness-of-fit test and the likelihood ratio test against the saturated model.

  abstract = {Self-report data are common in psychological and survey research. Unfortunately, many of these samples are plagued with careless responses, due to unmotivated participants. The purpose of this study was to propose and evaluate a robust estimation method to detect careless or unmotivated responders, while leveraging item response theory (IRT) person-fit statistics. First, we outlined a general framework for robust estimation specific for IRT models. Subsequently, we conducted a simulation study covering multiple conditions in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Ultimately, we showed that robust maximum marginal likelihood (RMML) estimation significantly improves detection rates for careless responders and reduces bias in item parameters across conditions. Furthermore, we applied our method to a real data set, to illustrate the utility of the proposed method. Our findings suggest that robust estimation coupled with person-fit statistics offers a powerful procedure to identify careless respondents for further review and to provide more accurate item parameter estimates in the presence of careless responses.},

Method               Pyramids and Palm Trees (Howard \& Patterson, 1992) test data that had been collected from individuals with aphasia were analyzed, and the resulting item and person estimates were used to develop simulated test data for 3 sample size conditions. The simulated data were analyzed using a standard 1-parameter logistic (1-PL) model and 3 models that accounted for the influence of guessing: augmented 1-PL and 2-PL models and a 3-PL model. The model estimates obtained from the simulated data were compared to their known true values.                                         Results               With small and medium sample sizes, an augmented 1-PL model was the most accurate at recovering the known item and person parameters; however, no model performed well at any sample size. Follow-up simulations confirmed that the large influence of guessing and the extreme easiness of the items contributed substantially to the poor estimation of item difficulty and person ability.                                         Conclusion               Incorporating the assumption of guessing into IRT models improves parameter estimation accuracy, even for small samples.

Under a full information likelihood estimation framework and MAR, ignorability of the missing data mechanism does not lead to biased estimates. However, this is not the case for pseudo-likelihood approaches such as the PL. We develop and study the performance of three strategies for incorporating missing values into confirmatory factor analysis under the PL framework, the complete-pairs (CP), the available-cases (AC) and the doubly robust (DR) approaches. The CP and AC require only a model for the observed data and standard errors are easy to compute. Doubly-robust versions of the PL estimation require a predictive model for the missing responses given the observed ones and are computationally more demanding than the AC and CP. A simulation study is used to compare the proposed methods. The proposed methods are employed to analyze the UK data on numeracy and literacy collected as part of the OECD Survey of Adult Skills.},

  abstract = {We develop a novel, general framework for reduced-bias M-estimation from asymptotically unbiased estimating functions. The framework relies on an empirical approximation of the bias by a function of derivatives of estimating function contributions. Reduced-bias M-estimation operates either implicitly, solving empirically adjusted estimating equations, or explicitly, subtracting the estimated bias from the original M-estimates, and applies to partially or fully specified models with likelihoods or surrogate objectives. Automatic differentiation can abstract away the algebra required to implement reduced-bias M-estimation. As a result, the bias-reduction methods, we introduce have broader applicability, straightforward implementation, and less algebraic or computational effort than other established bias-reduction methods that require resampling or expectations of products of log-likelihood derivatives. If M-estimation is by maximising an objective, then there always exists a bias-reducing penalised objective. That penalised objective relates to information criteria for model selection and can be enhanced with plug-in penalties to deliver reduced-bias M-estimates with extra properties, like finiteness for categorical data models. Inferential procedures and model selection procedures for M-estimators apply unaltered with the reduced-bias M-estimates. We demonstrate and assess the properties of reduced-bias M-estimation in well-used, prominent modelling settings of varying complexity.},

The properties of two-step estimators are examined using simulation studies and applied examples. They perform well, and have attractive practical and conceptual properties compared to the alternative one-step and three-step approaches.

Our primary focus was the comparison of its estimation methods, joint maximum likelihood (JML), marginal maximum likelihood (MML) with a normal distribution assumption and MML with a discrete distributions assumption when the populations were in fact non-normal. The simulation data sets were generated with two test lengths (10 and 50 items) and four alternative true population distributions for the abilities: normal, bimodal, uniform, and chi-square. As expected, results showed that MML-Normal was the best method when the assumption of ability distribution was matched, regardless the test length. However, the accuracy or MML-Normal decreased with the violation level of the assumption of normal distribution of the latent ability. The MML-Discrete estimation could overcome well the weakness of the MML-Normal when the normality of the ability distribution was violated. The estimates of the corresponding standard errors produced by ACER ConQuest 3 were also being examined and discussed.},

In practice, the item parameters are unknown and need to be estimated first from a calibration sample. Lewis (1985) and Zhang and Lu (2007) proposed the expected response functions (ERFs) and the corrected weighted-likelihood estimator (CWLE), respectively, to take into account the uncertainty regarding item parameters for purposes of ability estimation. In this paper, we investigate the performance of ERFs and of the CWLE in different situations, such as various test lengths and levels of measurement error in item parameter estimation. Our empirical results indicate that ERFs can cause the bias in ability estimation to fall within [               -               0               .               2, 0               .               2] for all conditions, whereas the CWLE can effectively reduce the bias in ability estimation provided that it has a good foundation to start from.},

We use integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) for accurate and computationally efficient estimation of the parameters.

Running time experiments and Monte Carlo parameter recovery simulations are performed in order to study the accuracy and computational efficiency of INLA when applied to the proposed explanatory additive IRT model class.

Each of seven prediction methods was evaluated through cross-validation approaches under three prediction scenarios: (a) unrealized responses of new students to existing items, (b) unrealized responses of existing students to new items, and (c) missing responses of existing students to existing items. The results of a simulation study and two real-life assessment data examples showed that employing student- and item-related background information in addition to the item response data substantially increases the prediction accuracy for new students or items. We also found that the EIRM is as competitive as the best performing ML methods in predicting the student performance outcomes for the educational assessment datasets.},

In this article, we revisit the long-standing idea that we should first estimate the measurement part, and then estimate the structural part. We call this the ``structural-after-measurement'' (SAM) approach to SEM. We describe a formal framework for the SAM approach under settings where the latent variables and their indicators are continuous. We review earlier SAM methods and establish how they are specific instances of the SAM framework. Decoupled estimation for the measurement and structural parts using SAM possesses three key advantages over simultaneous estimation in standard SEM. First, estimates are more robust against local model misspecifications. Second, estimation routines are less vulnerable to convergence issues in small samples. Third, estimates exhibit smaller finite sample biases under correctly specified models. We propose two variants of the SAM approach. ``Local'' SAM expresses the mean vector and variance--covariance matrix of the latent variables as a function of the observed summary statistics and the parameters of the measurement model. ``Global'' SAM holds the parameters of the measurement part fixed while estimating the parameters of the structural part. Our framework includes two-step corrected standard errors, and permits computing both local and global fit measures. Nonetheless, the SAM approach is an estimation strategy, and should not be regarded as a model-building tool. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {The intellectual history of parametric item response theory (IRT) models is traced from ideas that originated with E.L. Thorndike, L.L. Thurstone, and Percival Symonds in the early twentieth century. Gradual formulation as a set of latent variable models occurred, culminating in publications by Paul Lazarsfeld and Federic Lord around 1950. IRT remained the province of theoreticians without practical application until the 1970s, when advances in computational technology made possible data analysis using the models. About the same time, the original normal ogive and simple logistic models were augmented with more complex models for multiplechoice and polytomous items. During the final decades of the twentieth century, and continuing into the twenty-first, IRT has become the dominant basis for large-scale educational assessment.},

The topics are organized from the central idea of approximation by limit experiments, which gives the book one of its unifying themes. This entails mainly the local approximation of the classical i.i.d. set up with smooth parameters by location experiments involving a single, normally distributed observation. Thus, even the standard subjects of asymptotic statistics are presented in a novel way. Suitable as a graduate or Master's level statistics text, this book will also give researchers an overview of research in asymptotic statistics.},

  abstract = {IRT has been increasingly utilized in psychiatry for the purpose of describing the relationship among items in psychiatric disorder symptom batteries hypothesized to be indicators of an underlying latent continuous representing the severity of the psychiatric disorder. It is common to find zero-inflated data such that a large proportion of the sample has none of the symptoms. It has been argued that standard IRT models of psychiatric disorder symptoms may be problematic due to the unipolar nature of many clinical traits. In the current paper we propose to address this by using a mixture model to approximate the unknown latent trait distribution in the item response theory model while at the same time allowing for the presence of a nonpathological subgroup. The basic idea is that instead of assuming normality for the underlying trait, we will allow the latent trait to follow a mixture of normals including a degenerate component which is fixed to represent a non-pathological group for whom the psychiatric symptoms simply are not relevant and hence are expected to all be zero. We demonstrate how the zero-inflated mixture IRT method can be implemented in Mplus and present a simulation study comparing its performance to a standard IRT model assuming normality under different scenarios representative of psychiatric disorder symptom batteries. The model incorrectly assuming normality is shown to have biased discrimination and severity estimates. An application further illustrates the method using data from an alcohol use disorder criteria battery.},

We introduce new methods for power analysis and sample size planning that can be applied when marginal maximum likelihood estimation is used. This allows the application to a variety of IRT models, which are commonly used in practice, e.g., in large-scale educational assessments. An analytical method utilizes the asymptotic distributions of the statistics under alternative hypotheses. We also provide a sampling-based approach for applications where the analytical approach is computationally infeasible. This can be the case with 20 or more items, since the computational load increases exponentially with the number of items. We performed extensive simulation studies in three practically relevant settings, i.e., testing a Rasch model against a 2PL model, testing for differential item functioning, and testing a partial credit model against a generalized partial credit model. The observed distributions of the test statistics and the power of the tests agreed well with the predictions by the proposed methods in sufficiently large samples. We provide an openly accessible R package that implements the methods for user-supplied hypotheses.},

  abstract = {The bias of an estimator is defined as the difference of its expected value from the parameter to be estimated, where the expectation is with respect to the model. Loosely speaking, small bias reflects the desire that if an experiment is repeated indefinitely then the average of all the resultant estimates will be close to the parameter value that is estimated. The current article is a review of the still-expanding repository of methods that have been developed to reduce bias in the estimation of parametric models. The review provides a unifying framework where all those methods are seen as attempts to approximate the solution of a simple estimating equation. Of particular focus is the maximum likelihood estimator, which despite being asymptotically unbiased under the usual regularity conditions, has finite-sample bias that can result in significant loss of performance of standard inferential procedures. An informal comparison of the methods is made revealing some useful practical side-effects in the estimation of popular models in practice including: (1) shrinkage of the estimators in binomial and multinomial regression models that guarantees finiteness even in cases of data separation where the maximum likelihood estimator is infinite and (2) inferential benefits for models that require the estimation of dispersion or precision parameters.

Muthén (1993) proposed corrections to accompany certain categorical data estimators, such as cat-LS or cat-DWLS. Other applications of robust corrections exist. Despite the diversity of applications, all robust corrections are constructed using the same underlying rationale: They correct for inefficiency of the chosen estimator. The goal of this article is to make the formulas behind all types of robust corrections more intuitive. This is accomplished by building an analogy with similar equations in linear regression and then by reformulating the SEM model as a nonlinear regression model.},

  abstract = {AbstractRecent studies have pointed out the effect of personality traits on athletes’ performance and success; however, fewer analyses have focused the relation among these features and specific athletic behaviors, skills, and strategies to enhance performance. To fill this void, the present paper provides evidence on what personality traits mostly affect athletes’ mental skills and, in turn, their effect on the performance of a sample of elite swimmers. The main findings were obtained by exploiting a component-based structural equation modeling which allows to analyze the relationships among some psychological constructs, measuring personality traits and mental skills, and a construct measuring sports performance. The partial least squares path modeling was employed, as it is the most recognized method among the component-based approaches. The introduced method simultaneously encompasses latent and emergent variables. Rather than focusing only on objective behaviors or game/race outcomes, such an approach evaluates variables not directly observable related to sport performance, such as cognition and affect, considering measurement error and measurement invariance, as well as the validity and reliability of the obtained latent constructs. The obtained results could be an asset to design strategies and interventions both for coaches and swimmers establishing an innovative use of statistical methods for maximizing athletes’ performance and well-being.},
